* Usage

#+begin_example
  cal-hl -h | -c
  cal-hl [-f <file>] [-M|-S] [-y <year>]
  cal-hl [-f <file>] <-s <mark|alias> | -u> [<date> <date> ...]
#+end_example

Without any options, show calendar for the current year with marks
from =~/.config/cal-hl=. Use =-y= option to pick another year and =-f=
option to specify a custom data file. Week start by default is derived
from the current locale. You can override that with =-M= for Monday
and =-S= for Sunday.

=cal-hl= operates on marks and aliases. Marks are named ANSI sequences
used to colorize output. Default marks are =c0= to =c7= corresponding
to ANSI colors 0 to 7. An alias is an alternative name for a mark or
another alias. Default aliases provide user friendly names for default
marks e.g. =red= resolves to =c1=. Even though the default aliases are
self-descriptive, the resulting color depends on particular color
scheme used in a terminal.

Complete list of default marks and aliases:
#+begin_example
  c0 black
  c1 red
  c2 green
  c3 yellow
  c4 blue
  c5 magenta
  c6 cyan
  c7 white
#+end_example

You can customize marks and aliases with =~/.config/cal-hl-rc=. Use
=-c= option to dump current config and see the supposed format. Here
is the output for the default config:

[[./default_config.png]]

Use =-s= option with some mark or alias to mark a list of dates. Such
formats for dates are accepted:

- full
  - 20YY-MM-DD
  - 20YYMMDD

- current year
  - MM-DD
  - MMDD

- current month
  - DD
  - D

Remove marks for a list of dates with =-u= option.
